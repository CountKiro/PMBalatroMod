# PMBalatroMod
A Balatro Mod that adds custom made textures with Project Moon related characters, abnormalities and themes

## To install

1. Download and install, [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)

2. Download the ProjectMoonTexturePack.zip file from Releases on the right menu, extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the ProjectMoonTexturePack folder and there's an assets, localization and .lua file inside

3. [Optional] Repeate step 2 for the ProjectMoonMusicAddon.zip if you desire to include the music
   
5. [Optional] If you want to add the custom Balatro logo, you'll have to use 7zip to open up the Balatro.exe file located in the installation folder (Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro), navigate to resources -> textures -> 1x and replace the Balatro logo there. I provided the custom Balatro.png in my mod folder, inside the assets folder

6. In-game, go to Options and disable Pixel Smoothing. You could leave it on, but some sprites will be missing

7. Go to Options -> Texture click on the custom Eternal sprite and hit Enable. It'll move up top, meaning the custom Spectral textures are enabled

8. Enjoy the mod!


## Known issues

- The music is still a work in progress, so some tracks might get replaced in the future and timings and volume will get adjusted
- The Mika (Square Joker) and Walter (Photograph) textures are bigger than their vanilla counterparts, so they look offset and they cover up the BUY button on the shop. You can still buy them, even though you can't see the button
- Some older Joker textures are not on part with newer ones, so they'll be adjusted in the future
- Translations for other languages are not working. To fix this, you'll have to open your Balatro.exe (Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro) with 7zip, navigate to the localization folder and copy the language file for the language you want. Then go to the ProjectMoonTexturePack mod folder, go to localization and paste the language file there.
