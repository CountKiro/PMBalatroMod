## Installing the mod

1. Download and install, [Steammodded 1.0.0 beta (0614a)](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), [Lovely v0.7.1](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Malverk 1.1.3](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)

2. Download the desired ProjectMoonTexturePack.zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/CountKiro/PMBalatroMod/releases/tag/v.1.1) on the right menu (default has black backgrounds for playing cards, WhiteVersion has white backgrounds), extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the ProjectMoonTexturePack folder and there's an assets, localization and .lua file inside

3. [Optional] Repeat step 2 for the ProjectMoonMusicAddon.zip if you desire to include the music and ProjectMoonContentMod.zip if you desire the new content
   
4. [Optional] If you want to add the custom Balatro logo, you'll have to use 7zip to open up the Balatro.exe file located in the installation folder (Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro), navigate to resources -> textures -> 1x and replace the Balatro logo there. I provided the custom Balatro.png in my mod folder, inside the assets folder

5. Go to Options -> Texture click on the custom Eternal sprite and hit Enable. It'll move up top, meaning the custom Spectral textures are enabled

6. Enjoy the mod!

## FAQ

1. The custom logo doesn't show up!
Follow step 4 of the Installation instructions

2. Some of my spectral cards don't show up!
Follow step 5 of the Installation instructions

3. The game crashes on startup
Firstly, make sure you installed all the requirements listed on step 1 of the Installation instructions (with the correct versions). If it still crashes, make a post on Issues with the full crash log so I can analize it

4. Why is the music slowed down?
Balatro's code slows music down by default. I kinda like the lower speed of it, as I feel it fits more with Balatro's general vibe, but I have provided a sped up version of the music mod in Releases for those that prefer it

5. How were the characters chosen for each joker, planet, vouchers, etc?
- **Tarot**: chosen based on personality and backstory in comparison to the tarot's meaning. Lob Corp/ Ruina characters mosaic all have a close up of their eye in the Ruina design, a close up of part of their (human) Lob Corp design, their robot design and a defining moment of one of their CGs. Limbus characters all have the eye close up, their weapon,
an item related to them or their canto and a simplified sprite of a relevant person to their backstory (these last two are replaced with something else for sinners without Cantos)
- **Jokers**: about 85% of them were chosen out of either their personality, backstory, looks, the name/effect of the vanilla joker or their office. For example, Smiling Faces's gimmick in Ruina is stacking Smoke, which I translated ingame to jokers that have stacking effects. Cane Office is all about money, Molar Office is all about discards, etc.
Some of them complement each other, such Isadora and Julia working well together due to triggering on 4s. Some are kinda fillers, though.
- **Planet** (aka Sinners): going by Canto order (check run info)
- **Spectrals**: recreation of CGs from the games. Kromer creates red seals, Carmen distorts (changes) cards, etc
- **Vouchers**: Limbus characters, as well as representation for other non game media. They were chosen due to joker limitations ot allowing them to be included. With the new custom jokers, these sprites will be replaced with something else when Canto 8 custom jokers are included

## Known issues

- Certain UI elements are still using the old colour schemes
