## Installing the mod

1. Download and install, [Steammodded 1.0.0 beta (0711a)](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/releases/tag/1.0.0-beta-0711a), [Lovely v0.7.1](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Malverk 1.1.3](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)

2. Download the ProjectMoonTexturePack.zip file from [Releases](https://github.com/CountKiro/PMBalatroMod/releases/tag/v.1.2) on the right menu, extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the ProjectMoonTexturePack folder and there's an assets, localization and .lua file inside

3. Repeat step 2 for the ProjectMoonMusicAddon.zip if you desire to include the music and ProjectMoonContentMod.zip if you desire the new content
   
4. Go to Options -> Texture click on the custom Eternal sprite and hit Enable. It'll move up top, meaning the custom Spectral textures are enabled

5. Go to Options -> Customize Deck and for each suit, scroll to the end of the options and enable "PM (Black)"

6. [OPTIONAL] Go to Options -> Texture and enable "White Card". Then go to Options -> Customize Deck and for each suit, scroll to the end of the options and enable "PM (White)". You can also go to Options -> Textures and select between black and white backgrounds for the playing cards.

7. Enjoy the mod!

## FAQ

1. Some of my spectral cards don't show up!
Follow step 5 of the Installation instructions

2. The game crashes on startup
Firstly, make sure you installed all the requirements listed on step 1 of the Installation instructions (with the correct versions). If it still crashes, make a post on Issues with the full crash log so I can analize it

3. Why is the music slowed down?
Balatro's code slows music down by default. I kinda like the lower speed of it, as I feel it fits more with Balatro's general vibe, but you can change it to the normal speed by going to Options -> Mod -> Project Moon Music Addon -> Config, enabling fast music and restarting the game

4. How were the characters chosen for each joker, planet, vouchers, etc?
- **Tarot**: chosen based on personality and backstory in comparison to the tarot's meaning. Lob Corp/ Ruina characters mosaic all have a close up of their eye in the Ruina design, a close up of part of their (human) Lob Corp design, their robot design and a defining moment of one of their CGs. Limbus characters all have the eye close up, their weapon,
an item related to them or their canto and a simplified sprite of a relevant person to their backstory (these last two are replaced with something else for sinners without Cantos)
- **Jokers**: about 85% of them were chosen out of either their personality, backstory, looks, the name/effect of the vanilla joker or their office. For example, Smiling Faces's gimmick in Ruina is stacking Smoke, which I translated ingame to jokers that have stacking effects. Cane Office is all about money, Molar Office is all about discards, etc.
Some of them complement each other, such Isadora and Julia working well together due to triggering on 4s. Some are kinda fillers, though.
- **Planet** (aka Sinners): going by Canto order (check run info)
- **Spectrals**: recreation of CGs from the games. Kromer creates red seals, Carmen distorts (changes) cards, etc
- **Vouchers**: Limbus characters, as well as representation for other non game media. They were chosen due to joker limitations ot allowing them to be included. With the new custom jokers, these sprites will be replaced with something else when Canto 8 custom jokers are included

## Known issues

- Certain UI elements are still using the old colour schemes
- Oswald (base Joker) doesn't have a badge due to Malverk incompatibility
