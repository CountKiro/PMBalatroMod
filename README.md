# PMBalatroMod
A Balatro Mod that adds custom made textures with Project Moon related characters, abnormalities and themes

## To install

1. Download and install, [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)

2. Download the ProjectMoonTexturePack.zip file from Releases on the right menu, extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the ProjectMoonTexturePack folder and there's an assets, localization and .lua file inside

3. [Optional] Repeate step 2 for the ProjectMoonMusicAddon.zip if you desire to include the music

4. In-game, go to Options and disable Pixel Smoothing. You could leave it on, but some sprites will be missing

5. Go to Options -> Texture and enable the Spectral textures

6. Enjoy the mod!
