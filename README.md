# PMBalatroMod
A Balatro Mod that adds custom made textures with Project Moon related characters, abnormalities and themes

## To install

1. Download and install, [Steammodded 1.0.0 beta (0323b)](https://github.com/Steamodded/smods), [Lovely v0.7.1](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) and [Malverk 1.1.3](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk)

2. Download the desired ProjectMoonTexturePack.zip file from Releases on the right menu (default has black backgrounds for playing cards, WhiteVersion has white backgrounds), extract it and then place it in your Mods folder. You'll know it's correct if you open the ProjectMoonTexturePack folder and there's an assets, localization and .lua file inside

3. [Optional] Repeat step 2 for the ProjectMoonMusicAddon.zip if you desire to include the music
   
4. [Optional] If you want to add the custom Balatro logo, you'll have to use 7zip to open up the Balatro.exe file located in the installation folder (Steam\steamapps\common\Balatro), navigate to resources -> textures -> 1x and replace the Balatro logo there. I provided the custom Balatro.png in my mod folder, inside the assets folder

5. Go to Options -> Texture click on the custom Eternal sprite and hit Enable. It'll move up top, meaning the custom Spectral textures are enabled

6. Enjoy the mod!


## Known issues

- Certain UI elements are still using the old colour schemes
